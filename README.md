This project is daily fantasy sports lineups inspired. It is intended to generate lineups for a given list of games based on the fanduel rules. Eventually it will be used to analyze traits and stats of winning lineups and I would like to use some of those characteristics to filter out lineups. The goal is to not rely on my technique in randomly creating lineups but to have a more mathematical and data driven approach to creating lineups.
